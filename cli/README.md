`ajs-cli` exists to help you test analytics.js integrations simply and easily.

## Install

```sh
$ alias ajs=~/path/to/analytics.js-integrations/cli/index.js
$ ajs init # clones/downloads dependencies
```

## Usage

First, cd into the directory of the integration you'd like to test. We'll use convertro as an example here.

```sh
$ cd ~/path/to/analytics.js-integrations/integrations/convertro
```

Then, we'll generate the relevant settings information for the integration with:

```sh
$ ajs sync convertro
```

This generates a `~/.ajs.settings.json` file in your home directory. If you already have this file, it'll add add it as a key in json.

```sh
$ cat ~/.ajs.settings.json
{
  "convertro": {
     ...
  }
}
```

If you want to add settings or change existing ones, just edit that file.

Finally, we can run create a testing website with:

```sh
$ ajs up
```

Then you can connect to it on localhost:3000

## Quirks

### ajs up --no-rebuild

If you would prefer that ajs does not rebuild templates (which takes awhile), you can run:

```
$ ajs up --no-rebuild
```

This can be useful if you ctrl-c and want to open up the website again without making any changes.

### ajs <cmd> --verbose

Every command has a `--verbose` command that will show all the output of the commands it's running
behind the scenes. This can be useful for debugging the app, but isn't necessary for normal operation.

Example:

```
$ ajs up --verbose
```
