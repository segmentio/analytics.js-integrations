# analytics.js-integration-tag-injector

This integration is called a tag *injector* so as to not suggest it's as
fully-featured as a modern tag manager. But the basic idea is there: this is an
analytics.js integration that takes in settings, and creates `<script>` tags on
the page with those settings.

Why does this exist? See:
